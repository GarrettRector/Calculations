# Calculations

Calculations is a repository of mini Projects/Experiments and useful math scripts. These are often just fun little Experiemnts in python, but also contains scripts used mainly for math

# Timeline

The timeline for my projects started in 2021, where I first started to challenge myself in the world of computer programming. The rest follows like this:

### TRMS

* 8th Grade - 2020-2021

### GSMST

* 9th Grade - 2021-2022

# Dialations
#### First released on April 12th, 2021
The dialations project was the first project in this repository, and was me trying to both challenge myself and aid myself in my classes. This was my first independant, major python script, and the first final release turned out relatively well.

### May of 2021 Patch:
Fixed problematic basic rounding that prevented over 6 character answers from being properly displayed. The program would truncate everything after 6 characters, which meant if you had a 7 characters answer, it would only show up as 6

# Trigonometry
#### First Released April 14th, 2021
The trigonometry project was one of the harder math calculations projects because I started it without really knowing what I was doing as far as the math bit went, as well as the fact that the math was difficult to do at the time for me

# Radicals
#### First Released April 16th, 2021
The radicals script was the last script I produced for my 8th grade math year, and was the first time I used A LOT of for loops. I learned a lot from this project and though being quite simplistic, is extremely useful

# Coinflip
#### First Released May 10th, 2021
The coinflip project was more complicated then it had to be because I added so many extra functions. This project was more of a test of my skill, rather than a project, but nonetheless was fun to work on and useful in improving my python skils

# Random String
#### First Released May 14th, 2021

# Prime Numbers
#### First Released May 31st, 2021
