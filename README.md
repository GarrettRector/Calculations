# Calculations

Calculations is a repository of mini Projects/Experiments and useful math scripts. These are often just fun little Experiemnts in python, but also contains scripts used mainly for math

# Timeline

The timeline for my projects started in 2021, where I first started to challenge myself in the world of computer programming. The rest follows like this:

### TRMS

* 8th Grade - 2020-2021

### GSMST

* 9th Grade - 2021-2022

# Dialations
#### First released on April 12th, 2021
The dialations project was the first project in this repository, and was me trying to both challenge myself and aid myself in my classes. This was my first independant, major python script, and the first final release turned out relatively well.

### May of 2021 Patch:
Fixed problematic basic rounding that prevented over 6 character answers from being properly displayed. The program would truncate everything after 6 characters, which meant if you had a 7 char answer, it would only show up as 6
